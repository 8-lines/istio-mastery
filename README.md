This is the repo for the new series that picks up where "Kubernetes and Everything else" left us and continues with just as a bad title "Istio around everything else", here we will see the benefits of Istio and how it extends the capabilities of Kubernetes to simplify microservice applications by easily adding:

-	Traffic management: Timeouts, retries, canary rollouts, 
-	Security: End-user Authentication and Authorization,
-	Observability: Tracing, monitoring and logging.
